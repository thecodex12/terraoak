# TerraOak.workshops Users-API 

As API’s are prevalent in today’s world to ensure rapid product feature, lets talk about how we can secure them during the SDLC.  Lets take a simple use-case of  Company X who has decided that they want to build out an simple Users API.  The users api will be able to get and set a user using Api-Gateway, lambda, DynamoDB and S3.  As we embark on this journey, we will build out terraform code using Terraform Cloud, learn about design gaps we encounter using run-tasks and also apply a fix to secure our design gaps to ensure we  create a “secure by design reference architecture”.  We will also fulfil all of the compliance frameworks that Company X has to adhere to creating a very mature devsecops pipeline for the future.

* api-gateway
* lambda 

## Terraform Code 

The code in this repo should not be run inside of your company's aws accounts but rather in a playground account.   

## Requirements

| Name | Version |

## Getting Started Terraform Code Execution

* Download github code locally 
* Ensure requirements are met 
* Run terraform init 
* Run terraform plan/apply 
* Add a api user with following command 

`curl -X POST "$(terraform output -raw base_url)/set-user?id=0&name=john&orgid=xyx&plan=enterprise&orgname=xyzdfd&creationdate=82322"`

* Retrieve an api user 

`curl "$(terraform output -raw base_url)/get-user?id=0"`
 
`curl "$(terraform output -raw base_url)/get-user?id=0" -H "authorizationToken: allow"`
